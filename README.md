1: NLP Task using Keras and Tensorflow 2.0. 
  I creates a batch of sequences. Model has three layers of RNN, GRUs and a dense layer. Model is feeded by a string sequence of 128,None,128. Befor passing in the output need to expand and squeeze. Model predicts the number of chars as many number is passed.
